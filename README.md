# 🌱 My Coding Journey (2025 Edition)

Welcome to my personal coding portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of **everything I’ve learned, built, and explored in 2025 from [hackr.io](https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects)** — from beginner to intermediate (and eventually advanced) Python projects.

---

## 📚 What's Inside

This repo is like a digital notebook that tracks my growth in programming through hands-on practice. Each folder or file represents a **milestone**, a **lesson**, or a **challenge I overcame**.

You’ll find:

-   🧠 Beginner-friendly practice projects
-   🔄 Intermediate logic-based apps and mini tools
-   💻 GUI-based applications using **Tkinter** and **PyQt5**
-   📸 Projects involving **qrcode generation**, **image handling** with **Pillow (PIL)**
-   🔐 CLI-based security tools like password checkers
-   🧪 Notes, explanations, and sometimes **images or demos** for clarity
-   ⚙️ Projects with installation instructions and prerequisites (when needed)

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

I wanted a place to:

-   Track my learning journey
-   Keep a clean record of all the skills I’m picking up
-   Help others who are learning Python by sharing beginner-to-advanced projects
-   Encourage myself to keep growing as a developer

Whether you’re a beginner trying to find your footing or someone looking for creative project ideas, I hope this repo helps you too.

## 🛠 Technologies Used So Far

All projects are written in **Python**, and some use additional tools:

-   `qrcode` – for generating QR codes
-   `tkinter` – for building desktop GUI apps
-   `Pillow (PIL)` – for working with images
-   `PyQt5` – for creating modern graphical interfaces
-   `pyshorteners` – for shortening URLs
-   `getpass`, `random`, `time`, `re`, `os`, etc. – for various CLI-based utilities

As I grow, I’ll be adding **web-based apps, database projects**, and possibly projects in **other programming languages** too.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Most projects will include their own `README.md` file with installation instructions and required libraries.

> ⚠️ If a project is missing a prerequisite or doesn’t work as expected, **please open an issue or message me so I can update it** — this is a living, evolving journey!

## 🗂 Project Structure

```
📁 my-coding-journey/
|  📁 with-GUI
|   ├── qr_code_generator/
|   ├── url_shortener_pyqt/

## 📈 What’s Next

This repo will continue to grow as I:

-   Take on more challenging projects
-   Build full applications
-   Learn new libraries and tools
-   Share what I learn with the community
