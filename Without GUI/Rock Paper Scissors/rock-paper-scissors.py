Rock Paper Scissors Game Notes

Main Game Function: play_rps()
-------------------------------
- Gets input from the user and checks if it's valid ("R", "P", or "S").
- Uses the random module to let the computer make a choice.
- Compares the player's and computer's choices using if-elif-else statements to decide the winner.

Why Use a while Loop?
---------------------
- Keeps the game running in a loop until the player decides to quit.
- Resets game variables each round, allowing fresh starts.
- Enhances interactivity and user experience.

Exiting the Game
----------------
- When the user wants to quit, set play = False to break the loop.

Clearing the Screen
-------------------
- Keeps the screen clean between rounds to avoid clutter.
- Use 'cls' for Windows and 'clear' for Linux/macOS.
- Use os.name to check the operating system and run the correct command.

Validating Input with re.match()
--------------------------------
- Makes sure the user only enters valid characters: "R", "P", or "S".
- Uses regex to check if the input is one of the allowed single characters.
- If input is invalid, show an error and ask again.

Using random.choice()
---------------------
- Randomly picks between Rock, Paper, and Scissors for the computer.
- Keeps the game fair and unpredictable.
- Makes the code shorter and cleaner by picking from a list.

The __name__ == "__main__" Check
--------------------------------
- When the script is run directly, __name__ is "__main__" and play_rps() runs.
- When the script is imported into another file, __name__ is set to the file name, and play_rps() wonâ€™t run automatically.

Why This Is Best Practice
-------------------------
- Makes sure the game only runs when it should.
- Prevents the code from running if imported elsewhere.
- Helps keep the code modular and reusable for future projects.
