# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

A command-line tool that checks how strong your password is — based on length, character variety, and randomness (entropy).

Quick, simple, and secure!

---

## 🔍 What It Does

This tool takes a user’s password and evaluates how secure it is. It checks:

- Length of the password  
- Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)  
- Entropy (how random/unpredictable the password is)  
- Provides feedback on password strength

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to build a password checker in Python  
- What entropy means in the context of security  
- How to securely hide input using `getpass()`  
- How to validate password complexity  
- How to repeat the check using loops for multiple passwords

---

## 💻 How to Use

1. Open your favorite code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))  
2. Copy the code into a `.py` file  
3. Run it in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```
4. Type in your password when prompted (don’t worry — it’ll be hidden!)  
5. See the feedback and try different passwords if you like

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add a password breach check using the HaveIBeenPwned API  
- Suggest stronger passwords or passphrases  
- Build a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt for a more visual experience
