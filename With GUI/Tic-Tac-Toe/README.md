# 🎮 Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Python & PyQt5

Hey there! 👋  
Wanna build a cool little Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python? In this project, we’ll create a two-player game with a nice-looking interface using **PyQt5**. You click buttons, the game updates, and someone wins (or it’s a draw)!

It’s super beginner-friendly, and by the end, you’ll have a working game you can actually play with a friend—or just test your clicking speed. 😄

## 🤓 What You’ll Pick Up Along the Way

Here’s what you’ll learn while making this thing:

- How to make a GUI (app window with buttons and stuff) using **PyQt5**
- How to handle user clicks and respond to them
- How to build the game logic with Python classes
- How to update the board as the game plays out
- How to organize your code using OOP (don’t worry—it’s not scary!)

## 🛠️ What You Need to Get Started

### Step 1: Make sure Python’s installed  
If you don’t have it yet, grab it here: [python.org](https://www.python.org)

### Step 2: Fire up your code editor  
Open up VS Code, PyCharm, or whatever editor you like best.

### Step 3: Make a new Python file  
Something like `tic_tac_toe.py` will do just fine.

### Step 4: Install PyQt5  
You’ll need PyQt5 to build the GUI. Just run this in your terminal:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

P.S. Once you're done, feel free to show it off or even improve it. Maybe add score tracking or a restart button. Go wild!
