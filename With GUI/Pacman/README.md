# 🟡 Python Pac-Man Game (with Pygame!)

Hey there! 👋  
Ready to build your own retro-style **Pac-Man game** using Python? This project is a great way to dip your toes into **game development** while having a blast recreating a classic arcade favorite.

---

## 🎯 What’s This All About?

In this project, you’ll use **Python** and **Pygame** to build a 2D Pac-Man game — complete with pellets, ghosts, and a maze to explore. It’s super beginner-friendly and a perfect intro to making your own games!

By the end of this build, you’ll have:

-   A playable Pac-Man game
-   A basic scoring system
-   Moving ghosts and a maze layout
-   A full-on blast from the past 🕹️

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

This project is more than just fun — it helps you build some awesome programming muscles:

-   🎮 Using **Pygame** to build a 2D game
-   ⌨️ Handling keyboard input to control Pac-Man
-   🎯 Collision detection for walls, pellets, and ghosts
-   🧱 Working with grid-based layouts for the maze
-   ❤️ Tracking lives and score to manage the game state

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Let’s set you up so you can start coding right away:

### 1. Install Python

If you haven’t already, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

### 2. Set Up Your Project Folder

Open your favorite code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.) and create a new Python file — something like:

```bash
pacman.py
```

### 3. Install Pygame

Run this command to install the Pygame library:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

And you’re all set!

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

Here’s a quick breakdown of how your Pac-Man game will function:

-   **The Maze**: Grid-based layout with walls, paths, and pellets
-   **Pac-Man**: Controlled with arrow keys, moves around the maze
-   **Pellets**: Score points by eating them
-   **Ghosts**: Move randomly — avoid them or lose a life!
-   **Lives**: You’ve got 3 lives to score as high as you can

Simple, classic, and super fun to build and play!

## 🚀 Let’s Build It!

Open your editor, run the starter code, and let's get into the fun part — coding Pac-Man from scratch. You’re going to learn a lot _and_ have something cool to show off when you're done.
